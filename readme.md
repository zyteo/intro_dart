### Intro to Dart

const is used to declare a constant. Cannot be changed after declaration.
value must be known at compile time.

final is used to declare a variable that cannot be changed after declaration.
value must be known at run time.

runtime vs compile time: runtime is when the code is running, compile time is when the code is being compiled.

dart has null safety. If you want to declare a variable that can be null, you have to use the ? operator.
